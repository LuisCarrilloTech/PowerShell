# PowerShell

Hello, :smiley: I am excited to share my years of experience and knowledge in creating PowerShell scripts :man_technologist: with the community. Instead of updating both this repo and the modules in PSGallery<sup>[1]</sup>, I decided to make changes to one place to the published PSGallery instead. Please feel free to download and install them via command below for the latest updates:

# To install modules:
```powershell
Install-Module -Name RemoteGroup, RemoteLocalGroups, SysAdmin-Extras, VMwareAdmin-Extras
```

# To update modules:
```powershell
Update-Module -Name RemoteGroup, RemoteLocalGroups, SysAdmin-Extras, VMwareAdmin-Extras
```
