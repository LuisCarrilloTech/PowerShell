# PowerShell

Hello everyone. I am excited to share my years of experience and knowledge in creating PowerShell scripts with the community.

I want to offer a word of caution: while the scripts work well in my environment, they may not work the same in yours. Like all code on the internet, test, tweak, and deploy it where you see fit.

With that said, I plan to post new scripts as I come across the need to create them. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask.
