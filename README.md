# PowerShell
Hello everyone! I'm excited to be here today to share my years of experience and knowledge in writing PowerShell scripts. I've happy to share what I have learned over the years, and I'm eager to pass that knowledge on to the community. Before I get started, I want to offer a word of caution. While the scripts I share with you today have worked well for me, they may not work the same for you in your environment(s). Like all scripts and code you see on the internet. Test, tweak, and deploy it where it best suits you.

With that said, I'm happy to dive into the world of PowerShell scripting with you. I will be posting new scripts as I come across them. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask.
